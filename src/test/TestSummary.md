## Test Utilities and Mocking Strategy

### Mock Strategy
- **Hooks**: All custom hooks are mocked to isolate component logic
- **External APIs**: Supabase client and real-time subscriptions are mocked
- **Browser APIs**: Navigator, localStorage, and other browser APIs are mocked
- **React Query**: Query client is properly configured for testing

### Test Utilities
- **Wrapper Components**: QueryClient and Router providers for consistent test setup
- **User Event**: Realistic user interaction simulation
- **Waitfor**: Proper async operation testing
- **Custom Matchers**: Extended Jest matchers for better assertions

### Data Generation
- **Mock Data Factories**: Consistent test data generation
- **Large Dataset Generators**: Performance testing with realistic data volumes
- **Edge Case Data**: Malformed and boundary condition testing

## Test Execution and CI/CD

### Test Commands
- `npm run test` - Interactive test runner
- `npm run test:run` - Single test run for CI/CD
- `npm run test:coverage` - Coverage reporting

### Coverage Targets
- **Statements**: >90%
- **Branches**: >85%
- **Functions**: >90%
- **Lines**: >90%

### Performance Benchmarks
- Component render time: <100ms for normal datasets
- Large dataset rendering: <1000ms for 1000+ items
- State update handling: <500ms for 10 rapid updates
- Memory usage: No significant leaks after unmounting

## Known Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. Real-time testing relies on mocked subscriptions
2. Visual regression testing not included
3. E2E testing with actual browser automation not covered
4. Load testing with actual network conditions not implemented

### Future Improvements
1. Add Playwright/Cypress E2E tests
2. Implement visual regression testing with Percy/Chromatic
3. Add performance monitoring with real metrics
4. Implement cross-browser compatibility testing
5. Add internationalization (i18n) testing

## Test Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow existing naming conventions
2. Use appropriate test categories (unit/integration)
3. Include both happy path and error scenarios
4. Add accessibility checks for new UI components
5. Update this summary document

### Updating Existing Tests
1. Maintain backward compatibility where possible
2. Update related tests when changing component APIs
3. Ensure mock data remains realistic
4. Verify performance benchmarks are still met

### Test Data Management
1. Keep mock data in separate files for reusability
2. Use factories for generating test data
3. Avoid hardcoded values that may become outdated
4. Regularly review and update test scenarios

This comprehensive test suite ensures the Community and News pages feature is robust, accessible, performant, and maintainable.
