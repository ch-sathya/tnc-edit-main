# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing community group and collaboration room functionality by implementing a real-time collaborative code editor that supports multiple programming languages. The system will allow multiple users to work simultaneously on the same files with live cursor tracking, user identification, and synchronous coding capabilities. Additionally, it will improve the Supabase connection for file management and ensure robust real-time collaboration features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer in a collaboration room, I want to see other users' cursors with their names in real-time, so that I can understand where others are working and avoid conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user moves their cursor in the editor THEN the system SHALL broadcast the cursor position to all other users in the same collaboration room
2. WHEN another user's cursor is received THEN the system SHALL display a colored cursor with the user's name label
3. WHEN a user leaves the collaboration room THEN their cursor SHALL be removed from all other users' views
4. WHEN multiple users are editing THEN each user SHALL have a unique cursor color and identifier

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to collaborate on code files in real-time with other team members, so that we can work together efficiently on the same codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the editor THEN the changes SHALL be synchronized to all other users within 100ms
2. WHEN multiple users edit the same line simultaneously THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts using operational transformation
3. WHEN a user selects text THEN the selection SHALL be visible to other users with the user's identifier
4. WHEN users are typing THEN the system SHALL show typing indicators with user names

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to work with files in multiple programming languages with proper syntax highlighting and language support, so that I can collaborate effectively regardless of the technology stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is opened THEN the editor SHALL automatically detect the programming language based on file extension
2. WHEN editing code THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting for JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C++, HTML, CSS, and Markdown
3. WHEN typing code THEN the editor SHALL provide basic autocomplete and syntax validation
4. WHEN switching between files THEN the language mode SHALL update automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a collaboration room member, I want to switch between different files in the project while maintaining real-time collaboration, so that I can work on various parts of the codebase with my team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens a different file THEN other users SHALL be notified of the file change
2. WHEN multiple files are open THEN each file SHALL maintain its own collaboration state
3. WHEN a user joins a collaboration room THEN they SHALL see the currently active file and all available files
4. WHEN file structure changes THEN all users SHALL receive updates about new or deleted files

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the collaboration system to have reliable Supabase integration for file storage and real-time updates, so that all collaborative sessions are properly persisted and synchronized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are modified THEN changes SHALL be persisted to Supabase in real-time
2. WHEN a user joins a collaboration room THEN the system SHALL load the latest file state from Supabase
3. WHEN the connection is lost THEN the system SHALL queue changes and sync when reconnected
4. WHEN multiple users edit simultaneously THEN Supabase real-time subscriptions SHALL handle conflict resolution

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a collaboration room participant, I want to see who else is currently active in the room and what they're working on, so that I can coordinate effectively with my team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user joins the collaboration room THEN all participants SHALL see the new user in the active users list
2. WHEN a user is active THEN their status SHALL show as "online" with their current file
3. WHEN a user is idle for more than 5 minutes THEN their status SHALL change to "away"
4. WHEN a user leaves the room THEN they SHALL be removed from the active users list immediately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the collaborative editor to handle network interruptions gracefully, so that my work is not lost and I can continue collaborating when connectivity is restored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connection is lost THEN the editor SHALL continue to work in offline mode
2. WHEN connection is restored THEN pending changes SHALL be synchronized automatically
3. WHEN conflicts occur during reconnection THEN the system SHALL present merge options to the user
4. WHEN offline changes exist THEN the user SHALL be notified before synchronization begins
